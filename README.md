I developed a python code which creates a music player using Tkinter library.                 
This project was created as part of my internship with Code Clause.                                                       
The music player can play, pause, and stop songs from a user-defined playlist.
The project was written in VS code.                       
Here are some additional details:          
The music player uses pygame & tkinter library to read and parse MP3 files.          
The Pygame library is used to play the music files.                
The Tkinter library is used to create the user interface.                              
The project is modularized into different functions, which makes it easy to maintain and extend.                  
The project is well-documented, which makes it easy to understand and use.
